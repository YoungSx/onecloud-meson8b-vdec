# Deployment and acceptance status, 2026-11-14

Final driver is runtime-only on original 5.15.79-meson, with no reboot or
/boot writes. JPEG/HEVC and concurrent B-frame input are validated on
OneCloud. The systemd loader is reversible and its start/stop, failure
cleanup and removal were tested. The final installation leaves codecs
available, with installation-time originals retained in its state backup.

See evidence/HEVC-ACCEPTANCE-2026-11-14.md and
BFRAME-TRANSCODE-ACCEPTANCE-2026-11-14.md for frame counts, hash/PSNR checks,
malformed data boundaries and mixed-load run length. HEVC supports Main
8-bit linear output. Main10 and tiles remain explicitly unsupported; no
claim of arbitrary-stream or indefinite production soak is made.

Original WanOS ffmpeg remains installed. The independent static tool has
HEVC M2M decoding and a separate FFmpeg V4L2 drain/POLLERR patch. Both
sources and exact build flags are in the deliverable. On malformed data
ffmpeg may output partial frames; exit code alone is not acceptance.
Use scripts/verify-hashes.py and the recorded frame counts for correctness.

OpenList and Arcane were found stopped at the inherited baseline; their
original containers were restarted without configuration changes. They,
SublinkPro, VoCat and Home Assistant remained running during mixed-load
acceptance. The final HTTP and container checks are recorded separately.

The local linux-media RFC draft is prepared but unsubmitted. A current
mainline static-DT/power-domain port and review are still required for
upstream acceptance. No email or external publication was requested.

Verified release archive: build/onecloud-verified-release.tar.gz, SHA-256
71f7922e9a60cb9c4ae3bebb34181bf95f467a99e824f34d7bfd9daf9e3ff903.
Package source commit bd1cb79ad502d0b8cdcf9667a0ceb0ca0f7876ab.
Independent tools and all scripts are covered by the manifest.

Installed at /opt/meson8b-vcodec/current. The enabled and active
meson8b-vcodec.service leaves /dev/video0 and /dev/video1 available.
Pre-install firmware journal: /root/venc-deploy/verified-codec-state.
After ending codec clients, roll back using:

```sh
bash /opt/meson8b-vcodec/current/scripts/remove-autoload.sh
```

The final archive installation passed HEVC frame hashes: 10/10 small,
30/30 1080p B frames, 10/10 crop. JPEG returned all five requested frames,
including timestamps and LAST/EOS checks. See verified-deployment.log,
verified-*.md5 and verified-live-state.log under evidence/hevc-2026-11-14.
The original /boot hashes were rechecked against the initial snapshot.
Later documentation/evidence commits do not change the installed payload.
The rollback restores files as they were immediately before this install;
earlier experiment firmware already present then remains inert after unload.

The standalone v4l2-ctl 1.22.1 tool is under /root/venc-deploy/v4l2-ctl.
It enumerated both M2M devices, all coded/raw formats and controls. Source
and binary accompany build/onecloud-verified-source.tar.gz; the installed
runtime manifest remains unchanged. See v4l2-enumeration.log.

Interim failed runs are retained for diagnosis, not counted as acceptance.
The old recovery failure is hevc-recovery-interim-failure.log; final recovery
and independent-tool checks are hevc-recovery.log and reviewed-validation.log.
final-install.log/installed-hevc.md5 describe the superseded b8263f6 package;
verified-deployment.log and verified-*.md5 describe the final bd1cb79 payload.

Final source companion: build/onecloud-verified-source.tar.gz (136 MiB),
SHA-256 afd36fc89007b9a3793cc91cc8ba4207151c355b9634c47f3ad369d4cca1cb1a.
It contains exact bd1cb79 payload sources and a supplement from
15e4460769514a294b27bad5fcb5d420318e6109, including Linux/FFmpeg/v4l-utils
source archives, pinned microcode sources, reproduction scripts and evidence.
Its complete manifest was checked directly from the final archive.
